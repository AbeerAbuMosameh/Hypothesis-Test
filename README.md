# Hypothesis-Test
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and declare main characteristics. EDA uses data visualization techniques to provide a clearer understanding of the data. Hypothesis testing plays an important role in EDA by validating patterns statistically.

Hypothesis testing is a structured approach or statistical method to validate or reject assumptions and claims about a dataset/population. It evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. Therefore, it helps us make decisions based on data and evidence rather than intuition or assumption.

In this project, we will explore the application of hypothesis testing as an EDA technique using the Iris dataset, which consists of three different types of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) and their petal and sepal lengths.
